# AI-Based-Meeting-Summary-Generator
This project is an AI-based Meeting Summary Generator. It accepts video files up to 200MB, extracts audio from them, transcribes the audio using OpenAI's Whisper model, cleans the transcript to remove noise and irrelevant text, and then generates a concise and meaningful summary using a transformer-based summarization model like BART.
